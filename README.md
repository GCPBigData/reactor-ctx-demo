# Getting Started

## Introduction

A demo project showing the pros and cons of using the **Project Reactor Context** to *propagate and access data transparently through reactive pipelines*, as opposed to polluting/altering method signatures with unnecessary local variables or messy tuples.

Check out the [MultiplesController.java](src/main/java/it/dsibilio/reactorctxdemo/api/MultiplesController.java) and the [PrefixingService.java](src/main/java/it/dsibilio/reactorctxdemo/service/PrefixingService.java) classes.
